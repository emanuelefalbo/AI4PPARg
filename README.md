# AI4PPARg

This repository reports the initial stuctures and data of the work done at "Integration of Machine Learning and Atomistic
Simulations to Uncover Ligand Binding Patterns and Free Energies in PPARÎ³" submitted at J.Chem.Inf. Model.  The MD parameter
files, and representative structure files (PDB format) of the major representative complexes (cluster centroids) are publically made available.
The following files are MD inputs files used for the construction and MD simulations of all solvated complexes:

- tleap.in  : input for building  
- 01_Min.in : input for minimization
- 02_Heat.in: input for heating
- 03_Prod.in: input for equilibrating
- 04_Prod.in: input for production
- 05_Prod.in: input for restart production
